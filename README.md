Unlike DotNetAnywhere, IronNet came up with the idea of being bi-endian and with support for 31, 32 and 64 bit operating systems.
IronNet is being developed to be compatible with legacy operating systems or corporate operating systems, such as IBM i and Z/OS

IronNet is currently compiled and tested on the following systems:
- Windows x86 and x64
- Linux Debian x86 and x64
- Linux Debian powerpc and powerpc64 (big endian)
- Linux Debian ppc64le
- Linux Debian m68k
- Linux Debian sparc and sparc64
- IBM s/390 ( ISPF and OMVS )
- IBM z/OS ( ISPF and OMVS )
- IBM i (v6r1 to v7r4 ) ( ILE and PASE )
- IBM AS/400 ( v5r3 to v5r4 ) ( ILE and PASE )
